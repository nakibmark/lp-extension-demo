            <h1>D'oh!</h1>
            <p>
                Unfortunately for you, you've installed a terrible extension!
                For some reason, instead of creating something useful,
                the bumbling developer created what is essentially irritating malware!
                Jeez, someone should hire that guy and show him how it's done...
            </p>
            <p>
                This extension intercepts all anchor tags on all pages on the
                LastPass domain and instead of going where they reference,
                they open this vexing modal! To make matters worse,
                the bone-headed developer didn't even add a toggle!
                If you want to access your precious links ever again,
                you'll have to disable this extension in the Chrome menu!
                What a fool!
            </p>
